# Contributing to Dev Console CLI Bridge

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Dev Console CLI Bridge! This project aims to make browser console debugging more accessible to AI coding agents.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

**Note**: This project uses `package-lock.json` for development consistency, but it's not published to npm (users generate their own lockfile during installation).

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dev-console-cli-bridge.git
   cd dev-console-cli-bridge
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Test the CLI**
   ```bash
   node dist/cli.js --help
   ```

5. **Load the browser extension**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension/` folder

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Edit TypeScript files in `src/`
   - Update browser extension in `extension/`
   - Add tests if applicable

3. **Build and test**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ./start.sh  # Test the server
   ```

4. **Test with the demo page**
   Open `demo.html` in your browser to test the extension

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing code patterns
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests

Example: `feat: add support for custom WebSocket ports`

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start the server: `./start.sh`
2. Open `demo.html` in your browser
3. Click test buttons to generate logs
4. Verify logs are captured: `node dist/cli.js capture`

### Browser Extension Testing
1. Install the extension in developer mode
2. Navigate to any website
3. Open developer console and generate logs
4. Check if logs appear in the CLI

### AI Agent Integration Testing
```bash
# Test different agent formats
node dist/cli.js agent-info --agent cursor
node dist/cli.js agent-info --agent claude
node dist/cli.js agent-info --agent copilot
node dist/cli.js agent-info --agent windsurfer
```
